## 🚀 Key Components

### 🔗 Version Control  
- Integrated **GitHub** repository for managing all code and notebooks.

### 🔐 Security  
- Implemented using **Azure Key Vault** and **Azure Active Directory** to securely handle secrets and access controls.

### 🛠️ ETL Process  
- ETL logic is written in **PySpark**, run within Databricks notebooks for raw-to-clean transformation.

### 💾 Storage  
- Used **Azure Data Lake Gen2** to store raw, staged, and processed data layers.

### ⚡ Delta Live Tables  
- Set up **Delta Live Tables** for scalable, reliable, and declarative batch & streaming transformations.

### ⭐ Data Modeling  
- Transformed data into a **Star Schema** model for easy analytical consumption and performance.
