🔷 End-to-End Data Engineering Project with Azure Databricks:
This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data engineering pipeline using Azure, Databricks, Delta Live Tables, and PySpark. It simulates how raw data flows through various stages of transformation, storage, and modeling before becoming analytics-ready.

🏗️ Project Architecture:
A[Azure] --> B[Databricks]
B --> C[ETL - PySpark]
C --> D[Delta Lake Gen2]
D --> E[Delta Live Tables]
E --> F[Star Schema]
F --> G[Warehouse]

🚀 Key Components:
🔗 Version Control
Integrated with GitHub for CI/CD and collaborative development.
🔐 Security
Managed with Azure Active Directory and Key Vault for access control and secrets management.
🛠️ ETL Process
Data extracted and transformed using PySpark notebooks in Databricks.
💾 Storage
Raw and processed data stored in Azure Data Lake Gen2.
⚡ Delta Live Tables
Used for building streaming and batch pipelines
⭐ Data Modeling
Created a Star Schema for efficient querying and reporting.


📊 Outcome
✅ Hands-on experience with an industry-grade data engineering pipeline.
✅ Learned to manage data security, version control, and scalable ETL flows.
✅ Gained insights into real-time vs batch data processing using Delta Live Tables.
